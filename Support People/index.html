        <p> <i>" Homes and schools as well as vital infrastructure such as power supply lines, water sources and roads are all damaged or underwater. 
            Many people have been affected by floods for the second time in a month, after severe flooding also struck the region in mid-May.
             Shabel Firuz (Head of Asia, Islamic Relief Worldwide) says: “Many people are out of food and others will run out in the coming days.
              As markets are flooded and not operating, people have nowhere to buy supplies, so it’s urgent that aid gets through to them.
               “People’s houses have been damaged, washed away or completely covered in the flood water.
                Thousands of people are looking to make their way to flood shelters where they will need a lot of support. Islamic Relief’s office in Sylhet and the homes of some our staff have also been flooded.” Your donation can help save lives, please donate now.
            He helped us to save some extra money"</i>
